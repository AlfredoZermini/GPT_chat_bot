Since the country I am currently living in, Italy, has suddenly decided to prevent free access to chatGPT, I decided to implement my own chat bot based on the OpenAI services, following the tutorial from this video:

Just set up an OpenAI account, then copy and past your personal key into the ```hidden.txt``` file. 
Then run:

    python apy.py
 
Enjoy chatting.
